The solution involves using promises or async/await to ensure that the UI update happens only after the data has been successfully fetched from the database.  Proper error handling is crucial to gracefully manage potential network issues or database errors.  The code below shows an improved version.

```javascript
// Improved code snippet with async/await
async function fetchData() {
  try {
    const snapshot = await firebase.database().ref('path/to/data').once('value');
    const data = snapshot.val();
    updateUI(data); // UI update after data is successfully fetched
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching data:', error);
    // Handle the error appropriately, e.g., display an error message to the user
  }
}

fetchData();
```
This improved version ensures that `updateUI` is only called after a successful database read, thereby preventing stale data and UI inconsistencies. The `try...catch` block handles potential errors during data retrieval.  Using async/await significantly improves code readability and maintainability compared to traditional callbacks.
