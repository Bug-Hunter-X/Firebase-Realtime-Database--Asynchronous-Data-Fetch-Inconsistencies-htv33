# Firebase Realtime Database Asynchronous Handling Bug

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when working with Firebase's Realtime Database: inconsistent triggering of the `onValue` event listener, leading to stale data and UI update problems.  The bug is caused by the asynchronous nature of data fetching and the lack of robust error handling and completion indicators.

The `bug.js` file contains the problematic code that showcases the inconsistent behavior.  The `bugSolution.js` file presents a corrected version that addresses the issue by properly managing asynchronous operations, adding error handling, and employing appropriate mechanisms to ensure data consistency and timely UI updates.

This repository serves as a learning resource to illustrate best practices when working with Firebase's Realtime Database and handling asynchronous operations effectively.
